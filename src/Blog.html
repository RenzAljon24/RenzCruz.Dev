        <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-4xl lg:text-4xl xl:text-4xl font-bold m-3">Hello, World!</h1>
        <p style="color: 	#484848;" class="m-5">Welcome to my website! I'm an IT student who enjoys web development. This blog kicks off my journey as a developer, where I'll share experiences, insights, and some cool programming stuff.</p>

        <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-4xl lg:text-4xl xl:text-4xl font-bold m-3">Who am I?</h1>
        <p style="color: #484848;" class="m-5">My name is <span style="color: teal;"> Renz Aljon Cruz </span> , and I’m from Pangasinan, Philippines. I completed my elementary and high school education there, and during my high school years, I had my sights set on pursuing political science and becoming a lawyer. However, everything changed when IT students from the University of Pangasinan visited our school to give us insights about what to expect in the tech field. The tech talk got me all hyped up about programming. Who knew coding could be this interesting? And just like that, my journey to technology began.</p>

        <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-4xl lg:text-4xl xl:text-4xl font-bold m-3">The Path</h1>
        <p style="color: #484848;" class="m-5">My journey in technology has not been easy. With so many fields to choose from, I felt a little insecure and had doubts about myself. What if I didn’t excel? What if I chose the wrong course? These thoughts continued to bother me, but I didn’t let them stop me. I decided to study data structures and algorithms in advance, which helped me choose my career path in web development. I have always been fond of websites, which is why I began my first semester by studying different tools and programming languages. This helped me gain knowledge and confidence in my abilities.</p>

      <div>
        <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-4xl lg:text-4xl xl:text-4xl font-bold m-3">Let's Talk About My First Project</h1>
        <p style="color: #484848;" class="m-5">It was for our final requirements, supposed to be a group thing. But my competitive side kicked in, and I took on the project alone. However, when I began writing the documentation for my project, doubts crept in, and I got scared about what would happen if I failed to defend it. Initially, it was tough because some groups in my blocks had already finished their projects and were in the debugging phase. The never-ending doubt about my skills lingered, but then I realized I was on my own.</p>
        <p style="color: #484848;" class="m-5">I suggested creating my project without groupings, realizing that no one would help me except myself. So, I started working on the project. There were sleepless nights, and it wasn't easy, especially since I was also reviewing for our upcoming final exam. But I'm grateful that I challenged myself. I not only finished my project but also aced my exams, making me a bit proud.</p>
        <p style="color: #484848;" class="m-5">Then came defense day. I was nervous because the panelist was the IT head. As my time approached, they called me into the cold IT faculty room where I set up my laptop and documents. I bit my tongue, pinched my face, and told myself, "I can do it." And then, wow, I successfully defended my project proposal. I also received praise from the panel, saying, "Your skills are on par with those of a 3rd-year IT student. Congratulations!" I had many sleepless nights, and my confidence in my skills dropped to zero, but it all paid off when I successfully defended my project.</p>
